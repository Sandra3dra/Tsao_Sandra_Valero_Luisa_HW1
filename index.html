			<h1>OUR BIOGRAPHY</h1>
			<h2>Ting-Hsuan(Sandra) Tsao</h2>
			<p>My name is Ting-Hsuan, but I go by Sandra. I'm from Taiwan, a little island next to China. I came to Canada two years ago and I finished my high school in Chatham, a place in between London and Windsor. <br>When I have time, I like to sleep a lot. If I can marry an object in real life, it would probably be my bed. I like to cook things myself, try different things every time. It's like doing experiments. I like to draw, but I don't like to paint. They are two different things, one is to create a master piece, and one is to destroy a master piece. Maybe it's just my own aspect of painting is not what everyone thinks. I think I am shy and usually scared to start a conversation. The world is too big and it is just very difficult to remember how to interact with different people all the time. <br>I really like the program I'm in now. Although I did not expect anything we are learning now when I apply to this school, I'm quite happy with it. To be honest,I'd say I am a pretty lucky human.</p>
